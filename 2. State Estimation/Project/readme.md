# To Do List:
- Practice more about KF, EKF, ES-EKF, ..etc
- Learn about Quaternion and its relation to Euler angles and axes angles and Direction Cosine Matric DCM
- Good for you to use the Quaternion Class along with what you will learn and make your own reference.
- Highly Recommend to get to know Point Coud Library (C++) PCL
- Search about Iterative Closest Point Algorithm (ICP) which used to estimate the best transformation between clouds what describe ego(self) motion.
